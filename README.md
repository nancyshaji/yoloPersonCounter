# yoloCV
This code can be used as a person counter from images.

The original Code was from :

https://pysource.com/2019/06/27/yolo-object-detection-using-opencv-with-python/

 Changes were made so that images would be read from the images folder. Hence add images to be detected in that folder. 
 
 Download yolov3.weights from darknet or anywhere else: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
 
 This code doesnt even need darknet to be installed. 
 
 Outputs the number of persons detected.
