# yoloCV
The original Code was from :

https://pysource.com/2019/06/27/yolo-object-detection-using-opencv-with-python/

 Changes were made so that images would be read from the images folder. Hence add images to be detected in that folder. 
 Also output can be used moving the arrow keys.
 Download yolov3.weights from darknet or anywhere else: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
 
 This code doesnt even need darknet to be installed. 
 
 Outputs the index number of objects detected
